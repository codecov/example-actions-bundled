# example-actions-bundled

This repository demos how to use `actions/upload-artifact` and `actions/download-artifact` on GitHub
Actions to bundle coverage reports together before uploading. This is useful for repositories
that exceed 100 uploads per commit or to limit CI failures at the Codecov step.
